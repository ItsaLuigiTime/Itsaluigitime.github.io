Hello cyberspace! My name is Levi Shenk, and my email address is ldshenk@my.waketech.edu. This Github account is mainly for school at the moment, though I may continue to use it afterwards for ongoing projects, and all that work will be held here in this repository.

# About Me  

## My Interests  
* The show Critical Role, and its accompanying spinoffs, tv series, and merhcandise.
	* I've been a fan of theirs for almost a decade now, and contributed to the Kickstarter campaign that made their work into a TV show.
* Lifting weights
	* Too swole to control
* Dungeons and Dragons
	* See Critical Role
* My two _precious_ dogs
	* A Chihuahua/Poodle named ![Mayzie](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oDEDf-GzF6YPLkrbjkyxumOgNkt2hoYX/view?usp=drive_link) and a Chichuahua/Dauchsund named ![Finn](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHW_v55XN8JLZIwpeqX3fThSh3ah9KoE/view?usp=drive_link)
* 3D Printing
	* I bought one to print minis and terrain for D&D, and it just kinda progressed from there.


## Websites I Recommend

* [The Thingiverse](thingiverse.com)
	* This website is an excellent library of 3D models for 3D printing, and while there are many others like it, this is one of the first and most comprehensive. Virtually anything you might want to print can be found here, and its my go-to anytime my printer starts to look a little lonely.  
* [DnD Beyond](dndbeyond.com)
	* The official website for Dungeons and Dragons, this is an excellent resource for players and DM's alike, making it effortless to create and manage characters, monsters, and campaigns, even for those inexperienced with the game.
